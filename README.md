----
## **Requirements**
* Swift 4.0 +
* iOS 8.0 +
* macOS 10.10 +
* Xcode 9.0 +

## **Integration**

### Manually
  1. Just drag **SwiftyVK.framework** or include the whole **SwiftyVK.xcodeproj** into project
  2. Link **SwiftyVK.framework** with application in **Your target preferences -> General -> Embedded binaries**

### [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)
```ruby
use_frameworks!

target '$MySuperApp$' do
  pod 'SwiftyVK'
end
```

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
```
github "SwiftyVK/SwiftyVK"
```

## **Getting started**
### Implement SwiftyVKDelegate

For start using `SwiftyVK` you should implement `SwiftyVKDelegate` protocol in your custom `VKDelegate` class.
It is using to notify your app about important SwiftyVK lifecycle events.

For example:

```swift
import SwiftyVK
```

```swift
class VKDelegateExample: SwiftyVKDelegate {

    func vkNeedsScopes(for sessionId: String) -> Scopes {
      // Called when SwiftyVK attempts get access to user account
      // Should return set of permission scopes
    }

    func vkNeedToPresent(viewController: VKViewController) {
      // Called when SwiftyVK wants to present UI (e.g webView or captcha)
      // Should display given view controller from current top view controller
    }

    func vkTokenCreated(for sessionId: String, info: [String : String]) {
      // Called when user grant access and SwiftyVK gets new session token
      // Can be used for run SwiftyVK requests and save session data
    }

    func vkTokenUpdated(for sessionId: String, info: [String : String]) {
      // Called when existing session token was expired and successfully refreshed
      // Most likely here you do not do anything
    }

    func vkTokenRemoved(for sessionId: String) {
      // Called when user was logged out
      // Use this point to cancel all SwiftyVK requests and remove session data
    }
}
```
*See full implementation in Example project*

### Setting up VK application

1. [Create new standalone application](https://vk.com/editapp?act=create)
2. save `application ID` from **Preferences -> Application ID**
3. Set up **SwiftyVK** with `application ID` and `VKDelegate` obtained in the previous steps:

```swift
VK.setUp(appId: String, delegate: SwiftyVKDelegate)
```

## **Authorization**

SwiftyVK provides several ways to authorize user. You may choose one that more suitable:

### Raw token string
If you already have previously received token, just put it to this method

```swift
VK.sessions?.default.logIn(rawToken: String, expires: TimeInterval)

// Start work with SwiftyVK session here
```

`TimeInterval` - token expires time interval from now. Zero value is a newer expires.

### oAuth WebView
Standard authorization method which shows webView with oAuth dialog. Suitable for most cases.

```swift
VK.sessions?.default.logIn(
      onSuccess: { _ in
        // Start work with SwiftyVK session here
      },
      onError: { _ in
        // Handle an error if something went wrong
      }
  )
```

### Official VK Application

If user have official VK application on device, SwiftyVK can be authorized through it.
For this you need:

1. In *Xcode -> Target -> Info -> URL Types*

    - Add new URL Type like `vk$YOUR_APP_ID$` (e.g. vk1234567890)
    - Add app schemas to Info.plist file:

```html
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
  <array>
    <string>vkauthorize</string>
    <string>vk$YOUR_APP_ID$</string>
  </array>
```

2. Copy `Application Bundle` from
*Xcode -> $App Target$ -> General -> Bundle Identifier* (e.g. com.developer.applicationName)
2. Set copied `Application Bundle` to
*https://vk.com/apps?act=manage -> Edit App -> Settings -> App Bundle ID for iOS* field

4. Add this code to AppDelegate


  - For iOS 9 and bellow

```swift
func application(
    _ app: UIApplication,
    open url: URL,
    options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]
    ) -> Bool {
    let app = options[.sourceApplication] as? String
    VK.handle(url: url, sourceApplication: app)
    return true
}
```
  - For iOS 10 and above

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    open url: URL,
    sourceApplication: String?,
    annotation: Any
    ) -> Bool {
    VK.handle(url: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication)
    return true
}
```
4. Make auth like [oAuth WebView](#oauth-webview).

    ***If user deny authorization with VK App, SwiftyVK will present oAuth dialog***

## **Interaction with VK API**

SwiftyVK provides a very simple interface for interaction with VK API.
All requests performs asynchronouly in own private queue with API scheduler
(by default scheduler send no more than 3 requests per second).
You just can send it and get response without a lot of work.


List of all API methods is [here](https://vk.com/dev/methods)  

Let's look closer to requests syntax:

### Request
The base requests calls looks like **VK.methodGroup.methodName()**.

For example, [get short info about current user](https://vk.com/dev/users.get):

```swift
VK.API.Users.get(.empty)
    .onSuccess { /* handle and parse response */ }
    .onError { /* handle error */ }
    .send()
```

Object created with
```swift
VK.API.Users.get(.empty)
```
is represents a request that can be immediately sent or first configure and sent later.

### Parameters
If you want to get additional fields for concrete user in previous example, can set request parameters in this way:

```swift
VK.API.Users.get([
    .userId: "1",
    .fields: "sex,bdate,city"
    ])
```

Use `.empty` if do not want provide parameters.

### Callbacks
Request executes asynchronously and provides some callbacks for handle execution results:

#### onSuccess

This callback will be called when request was successfully executed and return `Data` object.
You can handle and parse response with any JSON parsing method
(e.g. `JSONSerialization`, `Codable`, [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) and others)

```swift
VK.API.Users.get(.empty)
    .onSuccess {
        let response = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: $0)
    }
```

You can throws errors within `onSuccess` callback
and this will cause to be called `onError` callback with thrown error.

#### onError

This callback will be called when request was failed for whatever reason.
You may handle thrown error in this callback.

```swift
VK.API.Users.get(.empty)
    .onError {
        print("Request failed with error: ($0)")
     }
```

### Cancellation

If you no longer need to sent sheduled request (e.g. screen was popped out), just cancel it:

```swift
// `send()` function returns `Task` object which has `cancel()` function
let request = VK.API.Users.get([
    .userId: "1",
    .fields: "sex,bdate,city"
    ])
    .onSuccess { print($0) }
    .send()

// Cancel sheduled request.
// onSuccess callback will never be executed.
request.cancel()
```

### Chaining

SwiftyVK allows make chains of requests. If you need to send next request
with data of response from previous request, just build a chain of requests:

```swift
// `send()` function returns `Task` object which has `cancel()` function
VK.API.Users.get(.empty)
    .chain {
        // This block will be called only
        // when `users.get` method is successfully executed.
        // Receives result of executing `users.get` method.
        let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: $0)
        return VK.API.Messages.send([
            .userId: response.user.id,
            .message: "Hello"
        ])
    }
    .onSuccess {
        // This block will be called only when `users.get` and `messages.send`
        // methods are successfully executed.
        // Receives result of executing `messages.send` method
    }
    .onError {
        // This block will be called when `users.get` or `messages.send` methods are failed.
        // Receives error of executing `users.get` or `messages.send` method.
    }
    .send()
```

You can make very long chains with SwiftyVK!

## **Configuring**
In SwiftyVK each session has default configuration for their requests.
Each request gets configuration from their session.
Configuration includes different settings such as `httpMethod`, `attemptTimeout` and others.

You can change configuration for single request

```swift
// Set different httpMethod only for this request
VK.API.Users.get(.empty)
    .configure(with: Config(httpMethod: .POST))
```

or for the whole session

```swift
// Set default apiVersion value for all requests in default session
VK.sessions?.default.config.apiVersion = "5.68"
```

You may change following configuration properties:

Property            | Default               | Description
:-------------      | -------------         | :-------------
`httpMethod`        | `.GET`                | [HTTP method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods). You can use `GET` or `POST`. For big body (e.g. long message text in `message.send` method) use `POST` method.  
`apiVersion`        | `latest version`      | [VK API version](https://vk.com/dev/versions). By default uses latest version. If you need different version - change this value.
`language`          | `User system language`| Language of response. For EN `Pavel Durov`, for RU `Павел Дуров`.
`attemptsMaxLimit`  | `3`                   | Maximum number of attempts to send request before returning an error.
`attemptTimeout`    | `10`                  | Timeout in seconds of waiting request before returning an error.
`handleErrors`      | `true`                | Allows automatically handle specific VK errors like authorization, captcha, validation nedеed and present dialog to user for resolve this situation.

## Upload files

SwiftyVK provides ability to easily file uploading to VK servers. For example:

```swift
// Get path of image file
guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "testImage", ofType: "jpg") else { return }

// Get data from image file on given path
guard let data = try Data(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: path)) else { return }

// Create SwiftyVK Media representation from given data
let media = Media.image(data: data, type: .jpg)

// Upload image to server
VK.API.Upload.Photo.toWall(media, to: .user(id: "4680178"))
    .onSuccess { print($0) }
    .onError { print($0) }
    .onProgress {
        // This callback available only for uploading requests
        // Use it to handle uploading status and show it to user
    }
    .send()
```

**Some upload requests do not immediately download files**


e.g `VK.API.Upload.Photo.toMessage` will return `photoId`
which you can use in `messages.send` method.
See [docs](https://vk.com/dev/upload_files) for more info.
## **Interaction with LongPoll**

## Start LongPoll

Also with SwiftyVK you can interract VK [LongPoll](https://vk.com/dev/using_longpoll) server very easily.
Just call:

```swift
VK.sessions?.default.longPoll.start {
    // This callback will be executed every time
    // when long poll client receive set of new events
    print($0)
}
```

## Handle updates

Data format describing on [this](https://vk.com/dev/using_longpoll) page.
LongPollEvent is enum with `Data` associated value in every case.
You can parse this data to `JSON` with any your favorite JSON parser like this

```swift
VK.sessions?.default.longPoll.start {
    for event in $0 {
        switch event {
            case let .type1(data):
                let json = JSON(data)
                print(json)
            default:
                break
        }
    }
}
```

LongPollEvent has two special cases:

`.forcedStop` - returns when LongPoll was obtain unexpected error and stop. You can restart it again.

`.historyMayBeLost` - returns when LongPoll was disconnected from server for long time
and `lpKey` or `timestamp` was outdated.
You do not need reconnect LongPoll manually, client will do it himself.
Use this case to **refresh data which could change during the network was unavailable**

## Stop LongPoll

If you no longer need to receive LongPoll updates, just call this function:
```swift
VK.sessions?.default.longPoll.stop()
```
